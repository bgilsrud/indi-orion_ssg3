Image capture:
It appears that OCS sends a stream of commands when an exposure starts

ICX419AK has 795x596 total pixels
effective 752x582 = 437,664 pixels at 16-bits == 875,328 bytes

    One of these is probably binning
    bRequest: 13 ???

    After exposure is complete, it's downloaded from bulk EP 0x82
    584 pkts 1568 bytes + 1 1536B packet + 1 96B packet
             1504 data

Additional information needed:

    It would be helpful to get image dimensions from OCS captured frame.

    Packet capture of image capture using 1x1 binning and 2x2 binning

    Set gain to 80 and 0 (or whatever the minimum that OCS allows)

    Does OCS provide temperature?

unknown commands:
    One of these is probably used to distinguish color vs mono
    13 always write
    20 always read
