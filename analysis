Image capture:
It appears that OCS sends a stream of commands when an exposure starts

ICX419AK has 795x596 total pixels
effective 752x582 = 437,664 pixels at 16-bits == 875,328 bytes

    bRequest: 13 - Set binning
        wValue is 0x0101 for 1x1 binning and 0x0202 for 2x2 binning
        
    bRequest: 31 - Set X readout start
            wValue: 0x0003 for 1x1 binning
            wIndex: 0
            wLength: 0

            This command tells the firmware which x position of the horizontal line it should start
            sending data over the USB. See the image labeled "Optical black position" in the ICX419ALL
            datasheet to explain this.

    bRequest: 32 - Set X readout end
            wValue: 0x02f2 for 1x1 binning
            wIndex: 0
            wLength: 0
            This command tells the firmware which x position of the horizontal line it should stop
            sending data over the USB. See the image labeled "Optical black position" in the ICX419ALL
            datasheet to explain this.
       
    bRequest: 33 - Set Y readout start
        1s dark:

    bRequest: 34 - Set Y readout end
        1s dark:

            The firmware might look something like this:
            for (y = 0; y < num_actual_rows; y++) {
                for (x = 0; x < num_actual_columns; x++) {
                    val = shift_out_pixel_from_ccd()
                    if (x >= x_readout_start && x <= x_readout_end &&
                        y >= y_readout_start && y <= y_readout_end) {
                        send_pixel_data_over_usb(val)
                    } else {
                        /* Drop pixel data on the floor because we don't care about it */
                    }
                }
            }
    
    bRequest: 16 - Start exposure

    After exposure is complete, it's downloaded from bulk EP 0x82
    584 pkts 1568 bytes + 1 1536B packet + 1 96B packet

unknown commands:
    One of these is probably used to distinguish color vs mono
    One of these is probably a temperature reading
    20 always read
    23 Ambient temp??
    24 Some sort of status?
    38 CCD temp??
    35 Read only, only seen when cooler is on. Status? bit 0 set means no cooler power??
